TAPAI: Transcriptome Processing by Artificial Intelligence

A program for training an A.I. model to classify sequences into several classes and for running predictions with trained models. Users provide the fasta files for training with each fasta file being considered its own class. During predictions each fasta file provided will be put through the model sequentially.
